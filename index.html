<a id="about-civicrm" class="anchor" href="#about-civicrm" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About CiviCRM</h3>

<p>CiviCRM is an open source CRM(Customer Relationship Management) system. Designed primarily for non profit organization, it addresses the needs of more than 10,800 organizations for an effective CRM. It is used for managing information about the organization's donors, members, event registration, subscribers and case contacts.</p>

<a id="project-description" class="anchor" href="#project-description" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Description</h3>

<p>The goal of this project was to develop a uniform functionality for synchronizing list/groups of email services like Mailchimp, Constant Contact and Google Apps with CiviCRM. This was achieved by providing a simple interface for simply selecting the service to be synced with CiviCRM. The synchronization process was carried on the contact information of the user accounts. Although the work is still under development for the Google Apps, the modules for Mailchimp and Constant Contact are ready to be used. This project was developed as a separate extension which can be easily installed with the CiviCRM account of the user. </p>

<p>After installing the extension, head over to the 'Generic Settings' tab in the Mailings menu item. Configure the settings of the desired email marketing service. Now you can simply go to the 'Generic Sync' tab under the Mailings item, select the service to sync with CiviCRM and click on the submit button to have your accounts synchronized in a simple way!! </p>
