  "body": "### About CiviCRM\r\nCiviCRM is an open source CRM(Customer Relationship Management) system. Designed primarily for non profit organization, it addresses the needs of more than 10,800 organizations for an effective CRM. It is used for managing information about the organization's donors, members, event registration, subscribers and case contacts.\r\n\r\n### Project Description\r\nThe goal of this project was to develop a uniform functionality for synchronizing list/groups of email services like Mailchimp, Constant Contact and Google Apps with CiviCRM. This was achieved by providing a simple interface for simply selecting the service to be synced with CiviCRM. The synchronization process was carried on the contact information of the user accounts. Although the work is still under development for the Google Apps, the modules for Mailchimp and Constant Contact are ready to be used. This project was developed as a separate extension which can be easily installed with the CiviCRM account of the user. \r\n\r\n### Links:\r\n:link: Project link:  www.github.com/AdiKare/org.civicrm.genericsync  \r\n:link: List of Commits: www.github.com/AdiKare/org.civicrm.genericsync/commits/master\r\n\r\n### Extension Usage\r\nAfter installing the extension, head over to the 'Generic Settings' tab in the Mailings menu item. Configure the settings of the desired email marketing service. Now you can simply go to the 'Generic Sync' tab under the Mailings item, select the service to sync with CiviCRM and click on the submit button to have your accounts synchronized in a simple way!! \r\n \r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n- First of all, I would like to express my utmost gratitude towards my Mentor Nicolas for his kindness and encouraging attitude. His readiness to help me in any difficulty was a big moral boost for completion of this project. \r\n- I would also like to thank Sunil Pawar and Sachin Doijad for their technical expertise and warm support. \r\n- Thanks to CiviCRM for being an awesome community and painting a positive picture of open source. I would love to be an active member and contributor towards CiviCRM in the future.\r\n- Finally, thanks to Google for giving me a great opportunity with GSoC and introducing me to the world of FOSS development. Its hard to believe that I have learnt so many things in such a small time developing code that actually matters. ",
